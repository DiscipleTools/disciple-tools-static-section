# Disciple.Tools - Static Section

Add a flexible section to the top navigation that you can add HTML or iFrame resources.

## Purpose

The initial application for this project was to take Google DataStudio reports
and create an iframe in the metrics area for the team to view. The visualizations were from
the advertising and online training efforts. This data can shape decision making, provide encouragement,
and guide prayer. Rather than building a complex integration, this simple
plugin allows you to create an iframe of the reports hosted in Google Datastudio. It can also be used to
make public almost any HTML page, like a list of downloadable resources, or the home page of a key partner
website.

## Usage

#### Will Do

- Add a top-level navigation item with a custom label.
- Add list items to a left menu similar to the metrics area of Disciple.Tools.
- Add, for every list item, a page with HTML/ iFrame content.

#### Will Not Do

- Do any API integrations or authentications.

## Requirements

- Disciple.Tools Theme installed on a Wordpress Server

## Installing

Install as a standard Disciple.Tools/Wordpress plugin in the system Admin/Plugins area. Requires the user role of Administrator.

The plugin is configured in the admin section of Disciple.Tools. [See the wiki for a configuration guide.](https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-static-section/wiki)
