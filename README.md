# Disciple Tools - Static Section
This simple extension allows you to add a new tab to the top tab area and add a menu of iframes or HTML content.

The primary inspiration/application for this project was to take Google DataStudio reports for website activity
and iframe them into the metrics area for a team to view early funnel data from Google Analytics. From this early effort
it became clear the same plugin could be used to display and distribute resources, as well.
