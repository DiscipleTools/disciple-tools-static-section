# Disciple Tools Extension - Static Section
This simple extension allows you to add a section to the metrics or top tab area, and add iframes or HTML.

The primary inspiration/application for this project is to take Google DataStudio reports for website activity
and iframe them into the metrics area. But other applications come to mind as well. You could add any iframe, like a 
Google form or any other kind of help resource or video resource series.
