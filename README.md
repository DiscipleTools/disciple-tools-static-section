# Disciple Tools - Static Section
This simple extension allows you to add a new section to the metrics or top tab area, and add iframes or HTML.

The primary inspiration/application for this project was to take Google DataStudio reports for website activity
and iframe them into the metrics area for a team to view early funnel data from Google Analytics. From this early effort
it became clear the same plugin could be used to display and distribute resource.
