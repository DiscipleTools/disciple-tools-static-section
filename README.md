# Disciple Tools - Static Section

Add a flexible section to the top navigation that you can add HTML or iFrame resources.

## Purpose

The initial application for this project was to take Google DataStudio reports
and iframe them into the metrics area for the team to view. The visualizations were from
the advertising and online training efforts. This data was important for the team in decision making
and for basic encouragement and prayer. Rather than building a complex integration, this simple
plugin allows you to iframe in the reports hosted from Google Datastudio. It can also be used to
public amost any HTML page, like a list of downloadable resources, or the home page of a key partner
website.

## Usage

#### Will Do

- Add a top-level navigation item with a custom label.
- Add list items to a left menu similar to the metrics area of Disciple Tools.
- Add, for every list item, a page with HTML/ iFrame content.

#### Will Not Do

- Do any API integrations or authentications.

## Requirements

- Disciple Tools Theme installed on a Wordpress Server

## Installing
